This is an agentic workflow making.

weâ€™ll build an autonomous research agent workflow. The workflow involves:
We could change target as well as our needs change:

Below the different steps:
- 1 -  Accepting a research topic as input.
- 2 -  Retrieving relevant web articles using an external API. \n
- 3 -  Summarizing the content. \n
- 4 - Storing the results in a local file.


Agents need a core structure to ``perceive, decide and act``

Step 1: Creating the Agent Framework

Basic ``Agent`` Class
Define a reusable Agent class that all agents will inherit.

Step 2 : Implementing ``Specialized Agents``

- Input agent: Accepts the research topic.
- Retrieval agent: Fetches articles from an API.
- Summarization agent: Summarizes the content.

Step 3 : ``Store`` summarized data
Step 4 : Orchestrating the ``Workflow``
